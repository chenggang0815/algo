973. K Closest Points to Origin
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

solution 1: time: O(nlog(n))
sort all the points, and find the k closet points => actually, we don't need to sort all the points and can get the k closet points

solution 2: time: O(nlog(k))
